Agenda and notes:

* TC39 summary
	* Optional chaining `?.` and nullish coalescing `??` are at Stage 3, shipping in various places (TypeScript 3.7 Beta, Safari Tech Preview 91, and Chrome Canary (with the experimental JS flag enabled). Some discussion about operator precedence, but planned to go to Stage 4 in December
		* (DR discusses some things about precedence, and weighing things… no real concerns)
        * NR: In babel we made the parens required, no one complained 
        * DR: It was at stage 2 only a while ago, but at the same time I agree with that sentiment - I don't think anyone was writing code that would be affected
        * DE: It was in some Babel/react presets when it was stage 1, so it's been around for a while/used by a lot of things.  It's fortunate we didn't really need any changes
        * DR: It would be interesting… sometimes when we make changes in typescript and we want to know how impactful it will be: BigTSQuery that is more or less github scraped, it's kind of a weird query language, but the premise is you can find how many people do 'document.all' and query in the wild.  It's a relatively lightweight way of getting some kind of approximation about what is happening in the real world - it would be nice to have something like that for JavaScript in general
        * DE: WE have HTTP Archive, but that will be transpiled output
        * BK: It would be kind of less than just transpiled, because it wouldn't include tools, and stuff on servers and so on.
        * DR: Yeah, it uses source code 
        * BK: Who has that dataset exactly?
        * (... some agreement to take this discussion offline and understand more)
        * GB: Don't logical AND and OR have the same precedence?
        * DE: Nope.
        * GB: Ah, so when you say the precedence is less than OR, is it a new precedence, effectively?
        * DR: It is technically the lowest, but they are really the same, you can't mix them.  They aren't associative.
        * GB: So if you were using it in an expression with a bitwise AND or OR
        * DE: Those are way tighter, you wouldn't need any brackets
        * DR: AND/OR both have to be disambiguated.  Really only to treat them equally, incase we need the room.  It doesn't seem clear that there are going to be a ton of use cases for a specific precedence, but if there is, in a year or two we can revisit that.
        * DE: So do you think this is an ok answer Guy?
        * GB: I have no real opinion, just sharing spontaneous thoughts/questions 
        * Proposal: [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining)
    * Records and tuples was introduced for Stage 1, with deeply immutable object-like and array-like constructs. 
        * NR: I think it will be hard to impossible for Babel to implement them? If an object has the same shape in different files it should be the same object, as I understand
        * DE: My understanding/thinking was that we could do this as an approximate implementation in babel that didn't pretend to be an exact implementation.  What do you think about that
        * NR: IF the records are in the same file, we can make it fully compliant, but if not, I think we can't.
        * DE: How would you cope with the spread operator
        * NR: Ah, true, I didn't consider that
        * RB: I started on some Babel implementation, it is like BigInt, it provides an approximate implementation as a library - it gives you some level of transpilation - but it is too low a level semantic construct to the whole thing, I think.
        * NR: I will take a closer look at the proposal - especially if you are willing to do that.
        * RB: I would love to get any feedback on it because writing Babel plugins is not something I am used to
        * DE: Great… any other questions on this topic?
        * DR: I think this is going to be interesting in TypeScript - it's not clear we have a clear way of dealing with this. There are suddenly kind of two kinds of hierarchies.  We already have tuples. Currently our policies on read-onlyness is more lax too.  So there's that, we'll have to think about it. The semantics are interesting - like .push() changes the arity - there's no way to do that with pop().  
        * DE: They will have different names now
        * DR: This problem is deeper, since we don't have a way to encode that a TS tuple type is row-polymorphic, as the .pushed() method would be.
        * DR: When it comes to a syntactic transformation we can encode that, there's usually a way.  But there's no way of saying it is the original …?... This may be tough, maybe that's ok - I'm not saying it is a blocker.
        * DE: It is designed to be typable, it would be really good to try to work those things out and work with us on it before Stage 3.
        * DR: yeah, let's work together here.
        * BK: I think I asked this in another context, but I can't recall the answer so let me ask it again… Will there be an equivalent way to parse into?
        * RB: Yes, everyone asks for this - we will add it at some point - there is an open issue.

    * Top-level await (Stage 3) implementation in V8 and integration into HTML/ServiceWorker is progressing (some restrictions)...
        * Proposal: [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-top-level-await](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-top-level-await)
    * Temporal proposal - a new Date replacement, continues to see evolution to its API. 
        * Proposal and polyfill:  [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal)
        * Slides: [https://pipobscure.github.io/temporal-2019-10/ ](https://pipobscure.github.io/temporal-2019-10/)
    * Modules/Standard Library Update: [ ](https://pipobscure.github.io/temporal-2019-10/)For now, the JS standard library continues to be developed as globals and properties of them. Many in TC39 hope that these can soon move to built-in modules, but we are using the tools we have for now.  Also work on changes for module types like JSON modules after feedback from Apple.
    * A UUID v4 generation function for the standard library was proposed for stage 1 
        * Proposal: [https://github.com/bcoe/proposal-uuid ](https://github.com/bcoe/proposal-uuid)
        * Slides: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LOLLs-OWB1hglv7NQc70UNwsEBEmx1ro/edit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LOLLs-OWB1hglv7NQc70UNwsEBEmx1ro/edit)
    * Upsert: A proposal for stage 1 that allows a developer to do an insert or update on a map.
        * Proposal: [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-upsert](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-upsert)
    * Declarations in Conditionals was offered for stage 1, it allows declaration of variables inside the expressions for conditionals  
        * Proposal: [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-Declarations-in-Conditionals](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-Declarations-in-Conditionals)
        * DR: We were wondering about ways to declare variables in expressions, like  let/in in functional languages
        * DE: I feel a little skeptical about this proposal, there were some things raised in committee about scoping.  Let-in becomes difficult - are these expressions or statements - usually we have scoped delineated by curly braces.  Once you have curlies -- it would take a lot of work to find something that could work here.  I really like the ideas, but there is a lot of complexity that emerges.
        * DR I do see why those are both difficult.  Maybe in the near future thats a thing we can discuss more with others. I was wondering - you were mentioning something about the precedence of nullish coalescing… was there more on that?
        * DE: Nothing that isn't on the issue.
    * "Wavy Dot" proposal / "Pleasant Notation for Promise Pipelining" for stage 1, provides syntactic sugar for working with promises
        * Proposal: [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-wavy-dot](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-wavy-dot)
        * Presentation/Slides: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikyK3hUJsN8&list=PLzDw4TTug5O0ywHrOz4VevVTYr6Kj_KtW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikyK3hUJsN8&list=PLzDw4TTug5O0ywHrOz4VevVTYr6Kj_KtW)

* Proposals to discuss:
    * Read-only collections (introduced for stage 1) - a way to be able to read Maps, Sets, Arrays, TypedArrays, etc without writing them. 
        * (DE presents slides in review)
        * GB is there any opportunity to unify them with records and tuples
        * DE: I think they are mostly orthogonal, RB?
        * RB: Yeah, I think they are mostly orthogonal. They do different things - no operators, they can contain mutable objects, which is something we can't do.
        * RG: The fundamental take away I got from this is records are scalars, basically while the read-only collections definitely maintain their object-ness.  I don't think that you could take these so far as to get the same qualities.
        * DE: There's an issue for read only views on arrays/typed arrays
        * GB: I see.  
        * RG: If you took the records proposal and started stripping away things like their scalarness, you would wind up with something like this
        * DE: I think they seem different.
        * (RG/DE discuss similarities with TypedArrayBuffers / data views and this)
        * DE: What sorts of use cases do you all see for this?
        * RG: the one mark presented was a runtime where the data was read-only
        * GB: I assume it is mainly security focused, right? Maintaining strong boundaries?
        * Proposal: [https://github.com/Agoric/proposal-readonly-collections ](https://github.com/Agoric/proposal-readonly-collections)
        * Slides: [https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/master/2019/10.readonly-collections-as-recorded.pdf](https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/master/2019/10.readonly-collections-as-recorded.pdf)
    * Module types like JSON modules
        * Apple and Mozilla are proposing that these use explicitly different syntax
* For next TC39
    * Proposal-array-select-reject for stage 1, some sugar intending to attempt to clarify whether filter includes (select) or excludes (reject) items  
        * Proposal: [https://github.com/jridgewell/proposal-array-select-reject](https://github.com/jridgewell/proposal-array-select-reject)
    * Iterator Helpers - several interfaces that will help with general usage and consumption of iterators in ECMAScript, for stage 3
        * Proposal: [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers)
    * Function Implementation Hiding - a proposal for directives that would hide implementation details from aspects like Function.prototype.toString and Error.prototype.stack for stage 3
        * Proposal: [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-function-implementation-hiding](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-function-implementation-hiding)
