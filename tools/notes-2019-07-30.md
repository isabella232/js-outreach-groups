Agenda and notes:

* TC39 status update
    * Optional chaining/nullish coalescing: Stage 3 (discussed last time)
        * Dan: 
            * Presented two versions of ?? - one with each precedence (and/or being the same, vs lower).  Most people on the committee seemed to have consensus that lower precedence was better.  That went through.
            * Presented optional chaining/call -- everyone wants optional chaining, but people have concerns with optional call. Nobody wants to hang up optional chaining on whether optional call makes it.  The one question is whether ?. should return the original LHS ("hello?.() should return "hello").  Yehuda was looking at use cases similar to react's useState. I'm working with him to work through those.  We'd love to get to stage 4 next time. One behavior of optional chaining is that it always returns undefined even if the lhs is null (e.g. should (null)?.(foo) return null instead of undefined).  People feel pretty strongly that the current behavior of returning undefined is the right call and consistent with libraries.  I'm curious whether others have opinions.  Changing it at this point would be harder than continuing with what we have.
        * Rob: You said you were hoping to advance to stage 4 next time?  Does this mean that you think that two browsers will ship soon enough?
        * Dan: We have babel and there is an outstanding pull for JavaScript Core, it might be possible to get typescript included - I think technically that would qualify.  Do you have concerns?
        * Rob: No I was just surprised because it's been pending for some time and it seems to have very quickly advanced.
        * Dan: If not next time, there is one in December -- I would like to get it done this year.

    * RegExp Match array offsets [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-match-indices](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-match-indices) stage 3
        * Ron: <explains>
            * Idea: today regular expressions give you substrings that match a regular expression, but it doesn't tell you where in the string those matches occurred. This proposal gives you the start/end offsets of the strings.
            * Has a polyfill - it's not very efficient: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/regexp-match-indices](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regexp-match-indices) 
            * Writing tests for 262 currently
        * Rajat: I think this is very interesting, I think it could be very useful for some of our existing cases.
        * Ron:  This is a little bit of incremental progress, it isn't enough to replace a lot of more capable things - it's a step.
    * Iterator Helpers [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers) stage 2
        * Dan: If you have an array today, you have all of these great helpers - filters, maps, etc.  As soon as you move into iterators though, you lose all of that, which is kind of terrible because those very often are the same sorts of things you want.  So what people do today is convert them to arrays often.  This introduces a lot of the same things for iterators.  It's currently not 100% clear what is being added to the spec or what is being proposed.
        * Ron: It includes initial spec text.  I've had some concerns, Jordan H has too.  We think in general it's a good idea, but maybe the wrong abstractions.  Some of my concerns are there aren't enough too.  There are a number of cases where ultimately you still need a lodash or something.  
        * BK: Is iterative value here potentially good as in the one we just talked about?
        * Ron: I don't know, that's why it isn't a hard objection - it's just a concern.  It is very useful for number of basic cases.  
    * Promise.any [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-promise-any](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-promise-any) stage 2
        * No real feedback â€‹
45
      * There was some feedback that maybe the syntax was confusing, we are working on it and concensus.
46
      * Guy: I initially was confused by what it was doing
47
      * Ron: It seems if it is not ambiguous and it kind of works in other languages, it should be fine- naming things is hard.
    * Explicit Resource Management [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management) stage 2
        * Basically syntactic indication that this block uses a resource, allowing resources to be disposed.  Prior Art: 
            * C#: [using](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-statement)[ statement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-statement)
            * Java: [try](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html)[-with-resources statement](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html)
            * Python: [with](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement)[ statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement)
        * Allows you to avoid nested try/catch/finally 
        * Syntax (below)
      * There was some feedback that maybe the syntax was confusing, we are working on it and concensus.
      * Guy: I initially was confused by what it was doing
      * Ron: It seems if it is not ambiguous and it kind of works in other languages, it should be fine
```javascript
try using (const x = expr) {
  
} // x is disposed
catch (e) {
}
finally {
}

try using (expr) {
}
[ catch/finally ]

try using (await readWriteLock.read()) {
}

```
       

* weak imports proposal [https://github.com/guybedford/proposal-weak-imports](https://github.com/guybedford/proposal-weak-imports)
  * Guy: It would be nice to maintain the same semantics of strong imports but be able to work with the cases where that is currently problematic.  If we can show that this can work, then I thought we might have something.  I haven't had much interest in it to be honest, but I thought it might work as a stage 1 proposal and I wanted to bring it up
  * Rob: Would it be possible to do this purely in a transpiler?
  * Guy: Yes, it is a very short spec.  It's mostly just the grammar.  I was wondering if it would be worth bringing up in the next meeting, I'm looking for a champion.
  * Rob: I don't want to commit, but let's keep talking.
