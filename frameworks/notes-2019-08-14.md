Agenda and Notes:

* RegExp Match array offsets [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-match-indices](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-match-indices) stage 3
    * [https://www.npmjs.com/package/regexp-match-indices](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regexp-match-indices)
    * BC: It seems super useful, regexp parsing is one of the few things that we had at node that required compiled dependencies, this would be great.
* Promise.any - [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-promise-any](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-promise-any) stage 2
    * BK: Confused a little about the failure
    * JR: Any success causes it to pass
    * JM: Is there an equivalent for 'any promise was rejected'
    * JR: There are several others, promise.all would do that… we also have / any / allSettled 
* adoptedStyleSheets / Observable DOM collections
    * Issue: DOM has no Set/Map/Array
    * [Prior discussion](https://github.com/WICG/construct-stylesheets/issues/45#issuecomment-458381676)
    * JF: So, a lot of the problem here is that these are that things we have are terrible… NodeLists, LiveNodeLists, etc… And I guess there is hesitancy to do something useful here without explicit permission from TC39, but as I understand we have that, so I am confused… What if we could convince DOM that it was ok to define in webidl host observable collections.  
    * BK: So these would be node lists?
    * JF: No, they would be arrays, only for new things
    * JM: .children maybe?
    * JF: I suppose there are newer versions of DOM APIs you could do if you used it
    * JR: Are you asking us to carve out a special class of collections or an explicit statement by TC39 that you could create an array that is observable or
    * JF: I think that this has already been said, I can look through minutes.
    * JM: Is it a matter of getting IDL merged as a start
    * JF: I think Domenic would be the person to ask… maybe it is just too much work?
    * JR: We can create exotic objects on the TC39 calls with explicit steps - like in array push "If host callback is defined, call the host callback"
    * JF: That seems fine, if it is necessary - will you be able to get support?
    * JM: this also addresses the fact that the FrozenArray approach does no comparison to previous value and is only destructive.

* Weak imports [https://github.com/guybedford/proposal-weak-imports](https://github.com/guybedford/proposal-weak-imports) Pre-stage 2:  
    * JF: This is wild, it's kind of interesting but…
    * BK: Yes, this is guy bedford's and he was interested in maybe introducing it - was kind of looking for support or a champion… I thought I would bring it here and see what people think.
    * JF: Why is it?
    * BK: It seems that web assembly has some similar needs, guy suggests we also have needs - it seems like it would be good if they could define the similar stuff and work together instead of differently
    * JR: What does Web Assembly do?
    * BK: [https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1281](https://meet.google.com/linkredirect?authuser=0&dest=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FWebAssembly%2Fdesign%2Fissues%2F1281)
    * JF: I'd almost like to see it expanded to cover some other use cases, it could be useful for 'polyfill-like' use cases for frameworks where you have 'dead weights' for most browsers.  Weak the entire import not just one export from the module… like, an optional import.   ImportMaps might be able to integrate somehow here.  There really might be something here related to polyfills.
    * BK: Would you be willing to follow up with guy?
    * JF: Yes, sure.
* Iterator Helpers -  [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers) stage 2
* Explicit Resource Management [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management) stage 2
