* **Agenda and notes:**
    * Quick summary of last meetingâ€™s items / progress & direction
        * These are â€˜elevator pitchesâ€™ about the features/proposals
        * Danâ€™s suggestion was that these assets could feed into the proposal readmeâ€™s MDN docs, etc
        * [https://gist.github.com/bkardell/2a28f181301a45a13fde2e64a4241d95](https://gist.github.com/bkardell/2a28f181301a45a13fde2e64a4241d95)
    * Review progress/drafts that several of us took up tasks on last time 
        * Private fields and methods (Dan and Brian)
            * [https://gist.github.com/bkardell/2a28f181301a45a13fde2e64a4241d95](https://gist.github.com/bkardell/2a28f181301a45a13fde2e64a4241d95)

        * Uuid (Johannes)
        * WeakRefs (Jory)
            * Doing a zine
                * Suggestion: once process is complete, share how I did it at meeting
            * [https://glitch.com/~zine-machine](https://glitch.com/~zine-machine)
            * Recruited TJ to help :D 
            * Suggestion: maybe use â€˜nuclear wasteâ€™ as analogy for â€˜this is not something you really need to worry aboutâ€™
            * Note from TJ: 
                * This is one of the notes i got from the slides: In general, avoid writing code that depends on the garbage collector cleaning up a WeakRef or calling a finalizer at any predictable time â€” it canâ€™t be done!
                * WeakRefs and finalizers can help you save memory, and work best when used sparingly as a means of progressive enhancement. Since theyâ€™re power-user features, we expect most usage to happen within frameworks or libraries.
                * TJ: Imma try to put in more of my thoughts like simple scenario (because there is code involve)
                * Tara Z. Manicsic : Maybe ðŸ‘†this is like make sure to clean up after yourself/stay neat and organized (clean code) so you don't overwork the janitor
                * See also: [https://v8.dev/features/weak-references](https://v8.dev/features/weak-references)

        * Temporal (Tara)
            * Waiting until next Monday as she has been slammed with work!
        * Top-level await (Brian)
            * [https://gist.github.com/bkardell/a8f3904c36b646f462c9dbdeac6aae0b](https://gist.github.com/bkardell/a8f3904c36b646f462c9dbdeac6aae0b)
            * Open to posting this where-ever
            * Tara suggested we adopt some shared code styles for examples
            * Group suggested perhaps a stronger conclusion / That we should tighten it up and get to 'what is' much more quicky, some of the build is less relevant.
