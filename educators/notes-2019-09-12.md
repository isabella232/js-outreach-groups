* Attendees
  * Brian 
  * Laurie
  * Maya
(Regrets from TJ/Jory)

* Agenda and notes:
  * Recap of what Laurie, Jory, TJ and Brian set up last month
    * https://twitter.com/StandardsIn2Min
  * Some suggestions from Laurie and Brian on how to efficiently move forward
      * The buddy system/pairing with a person you can actively work with a little more immediately seems successful - let's continue that.
      * Each month, pick a volunteer "editor"... The editor's job is to make sure to do active outreach to people who have pending stuff, sak for reviews on things, do the final read and ultimately make the command decision that something is 'ready' or not and manage the 'queue' of things to be shared that month.
      * Everyone can be on the lookout for short content that is appropriate, if you see some, send it to the editor.  The editor themselves can look/be aware of finding things for the queue (curating) a little more keenly maybe.
      * Agreed on all of the above
      * Maya volunteered to be editor this month.
  * Reviews/Scheduling in queue:
      * Optional chaining/nullish coalescing (Maya)
